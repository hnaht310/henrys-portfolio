                <br>
                Style: our current designs feature elements of flat and material design with more muted colors. newer design trends are brightening back up, adding back depth, texture, and lighting. What should Chess.com look like in 2021?

                <br>    
                UX: Choose web or mobile home screen. How do you present to all types of users the ability to experience our primary actions (play, puzzles, lessons), while also offering secondary features like Tournaments, Drills, and Puzzle Battles, but also have access to our awesome content, shows, events, and articles while also having layers of social elements, friends, clubs, leaderboards, stats, etc. There are lot of layers to this onion!

                Grouped similar elements, while keeping the depth of each element. In some cases I was able to flesh out functionality for certain elements. For example, I was able to add more statistical player data for multiple modes of play.

                The play button displays a profile image of friend to challenge friends without navigating from the homes screen.

                    I would also like to look at statistics of the most common actions done by users when look up other users and adjusted the search bar buttons to that. I would want the player profile element to automatically change to reflect the player’s information that’s being searched.

                    <p class="home-page-mobile-description">The home page’s player profile was one of the more difficult items to translate. The spacing between element and icon for each mode of play were too close to distinguish which number correlated to which icon. 
                    <br><br>
                    I added a bit of color to help separate each mode. The idea of colors was always intended in the desktop design but as an indicator to show which stat you were looking at, at the current moment.</p>

I was thinking of eliminating a few buttons to make the chances of accidental presses less likely. Ultimately, I decided against it. I would want to see how this page performs live to see if any changes would need to be made to it.</p>

                This was one of the only projects that i’ve done without any research or testing behind it. I made a lot of guesses and I feel like the design suffered from it. I really think this project highlighted the importance of research.

                I also ended up not winning the competition and only got 9 months of their premium membership for my work. A value of 79 dollars.
