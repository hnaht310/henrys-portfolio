          Our initial participants didn't accurately reflect our userbase. We

      </div>
      <div class="the-persona-guided-us-with-des">
        The persona guided us with design decisions. It helped with the creation
        of the journey map. The journey map itself wasn’t as useful since the
        project was only theoretical. Our persona used aspects like common apps
        to keep our design familiar with our users.
      </div>
      <div class="while-we-were-figuring-out-our">
        <p class="blank-line-p">
          While we were figuring out our users we began to think about our
          flows. How submitting a project would look is something we focused
          heavily on.

        <p class="blank-line-p">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="making-the-product-fun">
          We focused on ways that users could easily edit preferences while
          keeping the flow simple. At this point, we wanted to keep all the
          actions on one page. This helped churn ideas of how the UI could look
          so we wouldn’t be going into lo-fi design blind.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="in-a-longer-timeline-i-would">
        In a longer timeline, I would have wanted to explore more use cases for

        product.

      <div id = "section-diff-screens" class="i-gathered-4-designers-to-disc">
        <p class="blank-line-p">
          I gathered 4 designers to discuss ideas on how to incentivize
          feedback. We did a brainstorming session that was pretty light
          hearted. The loose environment helped cultivate out-of-the-box ideas.
          Some were more feasible than others and we proceeded with dot voting.
        </p>
        <p class="blank-line-p">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="making-the-product-fun">
          Dot voting helped focus in on ideas that were more realistic like
          offering an ad free experience in exchange for feedback. A solution we
          liked was offering prizes to top-rated feedback.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="our-first-concept-revolved-aro">
        <p class="blank-line-p">
          Our first concept revolved around keeping the site project based. Our
          users would have a general overview of their projects and could at a
          glance see who contributed to what project.
        </p>
        <p class="blank-line-p">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="blank-line-p">
          We discussed about our research and felt that this concept didn’t
          address enough of our users pain points. It focused heavily on the
          community aspect of building a project but lacked solutions to
          providing confidence in feedback.

          The visual layout of this sketch was something we liked and pushed

      <div class="this-concept-was-a-direct-resu">
        <p class="blank-line-p">
          This concept was a direct result of our thinking. Variable circles
          would represent individuals who contributed more to the project. This
          idea was attempting to tackle the issue of quality of feedback. The
          more an individual would contribute to a circle the larger it would
          get.
        </p>
        <p class="blank-line-p">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="making-the-product-fun">
          We had the idea of a coursel users would interact with to navigate
          between projects. This idea also had a similar visual layout with
          projects and a more in-depth view shown side-to-side.

      <div class="summarizing-these-sketches-int">

          Summarizing these sketches into a concrete list of ideas was helpful

        <p class="blank-line-p">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="blank-line-p">
          The circle concept was abandoned even before we jumped into our
          wireframes. We felt that this idea wouldn’t be practical for
          onboarding new users. There are established methods of showing
          interaction.

        <p class="blank-line-p">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="making-the-product-fun">
          The horizontal and vertical layout ideas were things we explored in
          our wireframes. The concept of having 2 separate ideas shown on 1
          screen seemed like a good idea to limit the number of screens the user
          had to navigate through.

          After these changes I was hitting close to the deadline. I wanted to

          Submitting feedback is a big issue with all our participants unclear
          of how they were supposed to complete the task. Watching the
          participant seemed like the issue was with the split screen design.
          They expected all of their actions to take place on the left side of
          the page and didn’t even look at the right side. Going forward the
          changes to make would be to move all the interactable elements to the
          left side of the screen. There could also be a version with the
          feedback form taking up the entire screen.
