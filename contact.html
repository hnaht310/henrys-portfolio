            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">My journey to design</h3>
            <p>When I went to a performing arts elementary school, I remember getting scolded by my parents for wasting ink from our printer. I had written a script that I was planning on convincing other students to perform. Admittedly, it wasn't good. It was a watered-down version of the Christmas Carol. I was 6.
            <br><br>
            I... acquired after effects as a kid and started learning compositing and animation. In middle school, I took a strong interest in claymation. I spent days working on 4 minutes clips of these nonsensical animated stop motions. When youtube came out, I jumped on movie maker and started recording and editing videos.
            <br><br>
            So much of my life and what I focused on centered around creative expression. But I had always felt a scratching desire for something more concrete. I learned coding fundamentals in middle school and went more in-depth in high school. I spent hours on problems and bugs and things that didn't work. These were my favorite times during coding because it felt like a puzzle with a correct solution. The existence of a correct answer is what I have always been looking for in my creative pursuit.
            <br><br>
            What attracted me to UX was the UI. But as I learned about research and testing and iteration. It was like a melding of these two worlds that I had always seen as opposites. I fell in love with design so profoundly. I can't see myself doing something else.
            <br><br>
            I'm Henry, and I'm a designer. I don't know if that was cheesy, but it's true.</p>

                    I had a chance to work with Henry in a group project where he was the team lead. He was easy to work with, very good at giving directions, and supporting other team members.

                    I had the pleasure to work with Henry on an agile workflow for a game design project. He is a very skillful designer and was a vital part of the team. He would be considered a unicorn because he not only knows how to design but also how to code.  On top of that, he has multi-media skills that can increase leverage for product development and the marketing team. His skills made our project more competitive. Collaborating with Henry was effective and easy as he is also a good communicator and knows how to defend his design decisions. Would definitely work with him again if given the chance.
